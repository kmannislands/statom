 [![Stories in Ready](https://badge.waffle.io/kmannislands/statom.png?label=ready&title=Ready)](https://waffle.io/kmannislands/statom)

An electron-wrapped node-based GUI for making statistics in the r language accessible and intuitive. **Statom** seeks to provide a flow based paradigm through which to manipulate data and create inferences and visualization.

Very WIP. Currently UI has been started, front end build and structure designed but I am looking for senior collaborators to consult on the design for the rest of the application.

## Installation

Requires git, [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)

Clone the git repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/kmannislands/statom.git
```
Install packages
```
yarn install
```
Start the live reload and watching with webpack, etc:
```
yarn start
```

## Technologies

Statom uses [electron](http://electron.atom.io/) as an application wrapper, [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) to package dependencies for the frontend, and of course [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) defined with [ES6 classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes) and complied by [babel](https://babeljs.io/).


## Contributing

Currently looking for collaborators. Shoot me a message.

I currently use [Waffle.io](https://waffle.io/kmannislands/statom) for a kanban or github issues. Standard git practices ie: issue -> branch -> pull request apply.
